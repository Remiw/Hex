Codes for Hexagonal Hodoscopes
for CAEN DT5560SE: raw_to_root create root files, works using WaveFormFunctions. accessTreeInfo2 displays amplitude distribution, persistence, and the diference of T0 distribution.
for oscilloscope: wfDisplay displays the signals for each event. Also shows the persistence, with y axis between -1,1. Code for create root files are still in progress.
